    Splits the input features and labels into training and testing sets for classification tasks.

    Parameters:
        X (array-like or DataFrame): Feature matrix.
        y (array-like or Series): Target labels (categorical/classification).
        test_size (float): Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split (default is 0.2).
        random_state (int): Controls the shuffling for reproducibility (default is 42).

    Returns:
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test: Split datasets with stratified class distribution.
